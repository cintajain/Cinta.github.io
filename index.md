# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/Seoul%20bike%20data%20analysis%20using%20linear%20regression.ipynb)

<img src="images/Seoul bike analysis.jpg?raw=true"/>

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Data Analysis](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/%20Portuguese%20Bank%20Marketing%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

<img src="images/Portuguese Bank Analysis.jpg?raw=true"/>

- Used logistic regression to build a model for predicting customer churn.
- The dataset include information about customer account information, gender, age range and also customers who have left the company within the last month.
- Used Logistic regression classifier & predicted the accuracy
- Explored a machine learning approach to customer churn prediction.
- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/Biomechanical%20Features%20of%20Orthopedic%20Patient%20Analysis%20using%20KNN%20%26%20NB.ipynb)

<img src="images/Orthopedic analysis.jpg?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Student performance analsysis](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/Students%20Performance%20Analysis.ipynb)

<img src="images/Student analysis.jpg?raw=true"/>

- Using EDA algorithm analyse the marks scored by the students in college.
- To understand the influcense of various factors like economic, personal and social on the students performance.
- To predict the major factors influencing the test scores and to improve students performance in eact test.

[Employee compensation](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/Employee%20compensation%20using%20K-means%20clustering.ipynb)

<img src="images/employee compensation analysis.jpg?raw=true"/>

- K-means clustering is used to predict the salary of the employees.
- The dataset is hosted by the city of San Francisco and is updated anually.

[Fake news detection](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/%20Fake%20news%20Detection.ipynb)

<img src="images/fake news analysis.jpg?raw=true"/>

- NLP techniques are used to create a model which predicts whether a given news is real or fake.
