# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/Seoul%20bike%20data%20analysis%20using%20linear%20regression.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Data Analysis](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/Tech%20I.S%20Assignment%20Portuguese%20Bank%20Marketing%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

<img src="images/Portuguese Bank Analysis.jpg?raw=true"/>

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](/sample_page)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
