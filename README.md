# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for TECH I.S. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

# Contents
* Machine Learning
   * [Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/Seoul%20bike%20data%20analysis%20using%20linear%20regression.ipynb): In this project we have used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul and examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on bike rentals.
   * [Portuguese Bank Marketing Data Analysis](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/%20Portuguese%20Bank%20Marketing%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb): This project is about the direct phone call marketing campaigns, which aims to promote term deposits among existing customers, by a Portuguese banking institution from May 2008 to November 2010. 
   * [Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/Biomechanical%20Features%20of%20Orthopedic%20Patient%20Analysis%20using%20KNN%20%26%20NB.ipynb): In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters with their classification as Normal or Abnormal.
   * [Employee compensation using K-means clustering](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/Employee%20compensation%20using%20K-means%20clustering.ipynb): The San Francisco controllers office maintains a database of the salary and benefits paid to city empoloyees between fiscal year 2013 to 2017. Our target is to predict the salary.
   * [Students performance analysis](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/Students%20Performance%20Analysis.ipynb): We have used EDA algorithm to analyse the marks obtained by students in various subjects.
   * [Fake News detection](https://github.com/cintamariyatomy/cinta.github.io/blob/main/NLP%20Fakenews%20Detection.ipynb): We are given two files with real news and fake news. Here we are using NLP techniques to create a model which predicts whether a given news is real or fake.

Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, nltk

* Data Analysis and Visualisation

Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib
